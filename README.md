# Work_Day_Scheduler_Moore
The Work Day Scheduler is a great app that includes coding lang. HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery. We also used bootstrap and moment features to make the coding more fluid and useful. The app allows the user to submit task within hourly slots and the app will tell if that slot is past, present, or future.
